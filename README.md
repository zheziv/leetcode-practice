# Leetcode Practice in Python

This repository documents my journey of improving algorithm and data structure skills using Python.  
I'm currently transitioning from traditional development to data engineering roles, and Leetcode is part of my technical sharpening process.

## Goals

- Strengthen Python syntax & algorithm fluency
- Prepare for technical interviews (FAANG-style)
- Document personal growth & problem-solving patterns

## Structure

Each file represents one problem.
I'll gradually add categories (Easy / Medium / Hard) and tags (e.g., Hashmap, DP, BFS).

## Progress

- Problems solved: 5 (will be updated)
- Language: Python 3.11.9
- IDE: VSCode / Jupyter

# Problem: Two Sum
- LeetCode #: 1
- Difficulty: Easy

## Approach:
- Use a hash map to track seen numbers.
- For each number, check if (target - number) exists in map.

## Code:
- Wrong sample (see `easy/1-two-sum.py`)
- Best answer (see `easy/1-two-sum-refined.py`)

## Completion Date:
- Jul 2, 2025

# Problem: Add Two Numbers
- LeetCode #: 2
- Difficulty: Med.

## Approach:
- Need to customize a function to reserve a ListNode
- Simplified without a function customized

## Code:
- (see `Med/2-add-two-numbers.py`)
- (see `Med/2-add-two-numbers-simplified.py`)

## Completion Date:
- Jul 6, 2025

# Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- LeetCode #: 3
- Difficulty: Med.

## Approach:
- Need to look out don't clear all substrings when duplicate happened. Or the later longest substring will also be cleared.
- Simplified and reviewed by AI

## Code:
- (see `Med/3-longest-substr-without-repeat-char.py`)
- (see `Med/3-longest-substr-without-repeat-char-simplified.py`)

## Completion Date:
- Jul 15, 2025

- # Problem: Longest Palindromic Substring
- LeetCode #: 5
- Difficulty: Med.

## Approach:
- Storing all palindromic substrings and lengths causes unnecessary memory usage.
- Keep track of the longest one directly, without storing all.

## Code:
- (see `Med/5-longest-palindrome.py`)
- (see `Med/5-longest-palindrome-refined.py`)

## Completion Date:
- Jul 30, 2025

- # Problem: Zigzag Conversion
- LeetCode #: 6
- Difficulty: Med.

## Approach:
- Learned how to use _ when the variable is required syntactically but I don’t need it.

## Code:
- (see `Med/6-zigzag-conversion.py`)
- (see `Med/6-zigzag-conversion-refined.py`)

## Completion Date:
- Dec 2, 2025
