# Leetcode Practice in Python

This repository documents my journey of improving algorithm and data structure skills using Python.  
I'm currently transitioning from traditional development to data engineering roles, and Leetcode is part of my technical sharpening process.

## Goals

- Strengthen Python syntax & algorithm fluency
- Prepare for technical interviews (FAANG-style)
- Document personal growth & problem-solving patterns

## Structure

Each file represents one problem.
I'll gradually add categories (Easy / Medium / Hard) and tags (e.g., Hashmap, DP, BFS).

## Progress

- Problems solved: 2 (will be updated)
- Language: Python 3.11
- IDE: VSCode / Jupyter

# Problem: Two Sum
- LeetCode #: 1
- Difficulty: Easy

## Approach:
- Use a hash map to track seen numbers.
- For each number, check if (target - number) exists in map.

## Code:
- Wrong sample (see `easy/1-two-sum.py`)
- Best answer (see `easy/1-two-sum-refined.py`)

# Problem: Add Two Numbers
- LeetCode #: 2
- Difficulty: Med.

## Approach:
- Need to customize a function to reserve a ListNode
- Simplified without a function customized

## Code:
- (see `Med/2-add-two-numbers.py`)
- (see `Med/2-add-two-numbers-simplified.py`)
